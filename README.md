# odin-landing-page
The second major project on TOP. This project incorporates the skills that I learned in both HTML and CSS. The project centered around recreating a webpage layout from a provided image and styling information. I was free to add my own images and text to create a landing page for a fake company. I was tasked with writing all of the HTML and CSS code from scratch, starting completely fresh. This project really helped me to strengthen my understanding because there was no hand-holding and I had to incorporate everything I learned so far. I got a bit carried away and added more styling than was necessary, but I was having so much fun seeing things come together. Specifically, I learned about and incorporated box and text shadows, hover effects, and transitions, which again was not required for this project, but I think added so much more detail and interactivity to the final product. I really had fun with this and learned a ton!
